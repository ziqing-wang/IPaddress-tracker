# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker

![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](src/images/desktop-preview.jpg)


## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, you'll be using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### What I learned

How to create a map by using Leaflets, and how to check if the input is valid IP address or domains.

```js
const ValidateIPaddress = (ipaddress) => {
    if (/^(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)$/.test(ipaddress)) {
        return true
    }
    alert("ðŸ˜¥Invalid IP address, please try again.")
    return false
}

const isValidDomain = (domain) => {
    if (/^(([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*[a-zA-Z0-9]|[a-zA-Z0-9])\.)*[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]{1,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/.test(domain)) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
